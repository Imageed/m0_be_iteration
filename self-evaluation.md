# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
Generally, i feel decent in my understanding of the each method, although i am not sure
if i would be able to do more complex arrays.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I had a bit of an Unproductive struggle, especially on the second challenge,
it turns out i just needed another "end" after i did that, my code worked fine.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I would like more practice using each, and understand where exactly i will be using it
an example would be nice
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
NA
